# Project Motivation
We chose to analyze credit card approvals because it’s not essential for individuals only but for society as a whole. It enables us to promote financial inclusion, manage risks, protect consumer rights, drive economic growth, and make informed, data-driven decisions in an ever-evolving financial landscape. By delving into this critical area of finance, we can work towards a more inclusive, secure, and prosperous financial future.
